NOTES ΟΝ THE TEXT.

Iu the following notes Σ means the reading or probable reading of
the parent rts os the Codex Spirensis. ‘l’be Codex Spirensis, with the
exception possibly osone leaf of it known as Folium Monacense, has
perished. What we know oi it is derived from the notes of Beatus
Rhenanus and sigismundus Gelenius, who used it in preparing the
second edition of Livy printed by Froben at Basle in 1535. From a
caresul compurison of these notes with the readings of other extant uss
Luchs has arrived with tolerable certainty at the following results,
published in his edition of Livy xxm-xxxa that the extant uss ol
this decade belong to two distinct sets, which however are derived from
oue archetype. This archetype belonged to the sixth century and was
already disfigured by gaps and errors. From it proceeded on theone
side Σ, that is, the ancestor urs of several extant MSS, and of the trs used
by Rhenanus, Σ being the parent apparently of a Ms (2') which was
the parent of the Codex Spirensis, and of the extant Codex Taurinensis.
From this archetype on the other side proceeded the Codex Puteanus
(P) a Ms of the eighth century now at Paris, so called from its original
owner, which until Luchs' researches was considered to be of pararnount
authority. It is now however shown that the readings of Σ (that is,
practically‚ the readings extracted by comparison of the Mss ol theu

branch) have an independent value, and may be used with advantage in
correcting errors in P.

Luchs’ researches have also exploded the theory formerly held by
several scholars (Madvig amongst the rest) that xxvt. 41. 18-42. 9 and
xxvn. a. 11-3. 7 (quam magna...Atellam), which do not appear in P,
were the composition oi an Italian of the r5th century.
