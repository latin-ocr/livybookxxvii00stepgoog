INTRODUCTION I. ix

Africanus had deprived him, and seemed likely to permanently‘
deprive him,.of assistance frorn that quarter. Sicily was entirely
lost to him. His politica] opponents steadily refused. him rein·
forcement's from home3 a selfish short-sighted policy, Dr-

Mommsen says. But it was at least a good imitation of
patriotic farsightedness to refuse to a brilliant adventurer the
means to glorify himself at his country’s expense, by making·
a conquest which could only be effected hythe sheer exhaustion
of his opponents, and which must either be worthless to the
conquerors, or impossible'to retain.

Hannibal then may be said to have practically failed in his
enterprise before the Metaurus, and it is easy, looking back with
a knowledge of subsequent events, to see that he could not
ultimately have succeeded. We may even go so far asto ,
say that he ought to have known that he could not succeed
For the only thing that could save him from failure was
such a blunder as that of Scipio's, and he could not with
certainty rely on such a blunder being made. But if he realised
this at the time, he was probably the only person who did The
Romans, so far from feeling that be had failed, could feel no
assurance that he would not ultimately succeed. The terror of
the senate when the twelve colonies refused further aid, and
the gloomy forebodings of certain ruin in consequence, are.
doubtless historical. And so are the no less gloomy apprehen-
sions expressed even as late as when Nero was on his way
to join Livius. lt is true that the Romans had met with
successes, notably in Sicily and Spain, and in Italy in the
recapture of Capua and Tarentum. But, as Dr Mommsen
has well pointed out, the wars in Spain and Sicily were purely
defensive on the part of the Romans and, so far as they knew,
only staved off danger for the time ¹. The recapture of Capua
was no doubt a great success. But it was by no means followed
by such decisive results as to give the Romans assurance of
ultimate victory. The recovery of Tarentum was also a great
success, though on the showing of the Annalists themselves it
was due to good luck rather than great generalship. But after
all the fact remained that Hannibal was still roving unchecked
