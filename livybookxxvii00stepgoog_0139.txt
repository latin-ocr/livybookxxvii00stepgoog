into dii certi, incerti and selecti. The first, belonging to the oldest form

terms ceree· dre. or round them is quit: uncertain. From this passage it
would seem es ii they belonged to pontifical lore. But it is quite
possible that Livy got the phrase out oi Varro; Marquardt, 111. re. It
isqnite possible also, as Weissenb. suggests, that Iivy does not use certis
in this technical sense, bnt means special deities mentioned in the ponti-
fical books as deities that could be worshipped in pairs.
