(socie), consisting of infantry and cavalry. The infantry numbered about
one-fifth more than the Roman (legionary) infantry, the cavalry were
three times as many as the Roman cavalry. One-fifth of the infantry
and one-third of the cavalry were selected to attend upon the commander
under the name of extraordinarii. The remainder were divided into
two bodies called ala dartra and alo rinirtra, the name alo being
applied to the contingent of socii (as it was also to the legionary
cavam) because they were supposed to form the wings of the army.
The socii were apparently equipped and discipliued in the same way
as the Roman or legionary troops. The infantry of each ala was,
apparently, divided into ten cohortes of from 400 to 600 men each.
It had three Roman officers (praefecti socium) corresponding to the
tribunes in the legions, and ten native oflicers (praefecti cohortium),
one to each oohort. The cavalry were divided into four squadrons
(also called alae in a narrower sense) known collectively as equites
alares. The extraordinarii were divided, the infantry into four eohorts
(cohortes extraordinariae), the cavalry into two alae (alae extraordinariae).

On tln’s occasion Fulvius adopted an arrangement often employed at
this time. He placed one legion and the a'mistra olo in front, and kept
the other legion with the dextra alain reserva· Cs. c. a, 9 7.

executed until the reserve had entered the light. But the reading is
doubtful. See notes on the text.
