c ao ἓ 2 <alter Polybius) is quite inadequate, and we are driven
to the conclusion that Scipio either suffered some reverse or
committed some grave error, which as the confidential agent of
the gods he seit bound in honour to them to conceal

2. ln several cases Livy admits inconsistencies into his
history either from misunderstanding his authorities or from
adopting the accounts of different authorities in different parts
oi his narrative. One or two instances will suffice as examples
ln c. 7 ᾖ 1 (as pointed out in the note) he despatches Laelius
from Tarraco to Rome, iorgetting apparently that in xxvi. 51. a
be had, following another account, made him sail from New
Carthage. ln c. 7 5 5, Livy fures the date of the capture of
New Carthage in lac, 210, because, he says, it was incredible
that Scipio should be a whole year in Spain without achieving
some success. But he thus assumes that Scipio went to Spain
nc. 211, whereas Polybius makes him begin operations in Spain ¹
in nc. 209, and he does not reflect that according to his own
reckoning Scipio must have done nothing all the year ne 208.

Here probably he either misunderstood the authors he compiled , ’ Γ

from, or took the statements of different authors and combined
them without comparing or siiting them. ln c. 165 3 he speaks
of Philemenus as if he were the sole author of the betrayal of
Tarentum to Hannibal. But in xxv. 8. 1 he represents Nico
and Philemenus as both equally responsible for that action.
Evidently in these two places he was working from the accounts
of different Annalists. ln c. 34, adopting evidently the state·
ment of the Annalist heis using, he speaks ol Nero as quite the
ioremost manin Rome. That may have been true. But Livy
has said nothing about Nero to prepare us for such a large
statement. Practically all that we know about him srom Livy
is that on two occasions he sailed as a military commender,
once in Italy rac. 214 when he was acting under Marcellus, and

once in Spain, when he allowed Hasdrubal to out-wit him (cf. c.
49). These instances are sufficient to show how little Livy is
to be trusted unless his statements arc corroborated by other
facts or by a reliable historiari such as Polybius in the main is,

and how little we really know about the details oi this partos
the war, for which Livy is our principal authority.
