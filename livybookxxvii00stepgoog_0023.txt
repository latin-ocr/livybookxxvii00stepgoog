xx LIVY. XXVII.

trepidantium. necopinantium which has been suggested would be a
better emendation. But pugnantium is intelligible and has uss
authority.

59. Fulviis] P, retained by Mg, who says, Latine similitudinem

increpare duntur, non iu similitudinem. Others in Fuluii simili·
tudinem nominis.

§1¹0 ante] is probably wrong. ante...deinde=primnm...deindeis
quite unparalleled.

2. 51. atque] Σ, probably right. Livy·s usual combinations in
this phrase are atque or que, very seldom et.

54. connel] Friedersd. inserts at before comui, quite unnecessarily,
seen. a. 9.

57. stetit. nt] Mg3 nt wanting in uss. Weissenb. inserts uti
before diu, and punctuates stetit„ But, as Mg says, that would require
steterat. Mg's emendation also avoids harsh asyndeton at marem.

8. §4- ut] wanting in uss. Most editors insert it, instead of
changing incenderent (uss) into incendere as Weisseub.

59. sanarum] has good uss authority. Weissenb. omits it, on
the ground, mistalreu apparently, that the urban army consisted ot
Romans only.

6. 54. mminem δια] Mg's rearrangement oi the text. Most
editors retain qni...afieerint between Siculum and nan; marinum
Siculum qni :neminem Siculorum earum qui is awkward and not
Livian Latin. The words in that position spoil the balance oi the
sentences, besides introducing rather a feeble modificationes Laevinus'
description os his merits.

ο. t 15· sactus...0rassi] bracketed as spurious by Mg. 'Ibe
repetition is useless and misleading, as suggesting that two men were
replaced instead oi one.

fl 19. apparatas] Σ, seems preferable to magnifici apparatur retained
by Mg. The qualllying clause pro...copiais rather harshly plaoed with
the latter reading.

⁷. fi 3. obsistentem] emendation of uss subsistentem. The latteris
not used with dat. in good writers. In the two passages where it
ocmrs, Cic. ad Fam. xt. ro. 5 and Tibullus tv, r. 195· the text is
corrupt. The corruption here would easily arise from a doubling oi the
preceding s.

516. placere] supplied irom Σ, is required sor the construction.
Weissenb. omits it, and supplies russum from the context, but does not
suggest how to translate it. The only alternative is Mg’s suggestion
