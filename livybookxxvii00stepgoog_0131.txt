¹4 9²· antesrgnanr] it isdifficult to understand what Livy means by'
this word here. Generally speaking it means the front maniples ol the
legion fighting in frontes their standards‚ which in battle were placed in
the hindmost maniples of the division. Ordinarily the hastati would be
the antesigrnnr‘. 1t they were ‚obliged to retire, then the principer
would become arrtesignane'. This signification does not seem to apply
here. 1 am inclined to think that the word here is in some way
synonymous or nearly so with vele'tes (though elsewhere they are
distinguished). But so little is known about the velites, the skirmishers
of the army, who appear sor the first time in this war, that it is im·
possible to say how they might be included in the tenu antesignani.
The head of a column in merching order as a rule was formed oi the
extraordinarii followed by the dextra ala soa'ornm.
