question before the plebis canalium (comittit tributa), cf. ἓ 7. This
mode of nominating a dictator was quite exceptional. After the

battle of Lake Trasimenus Fabius was appointed dictator by resolution
of the people, became one consul was dead and the other absent. On
that occasion also a praetor must have held the cumdio.

29 fl 1⁷. quod...esret] the naming of a dictator, after the senate had
author-ised it, was entirely at the discretiori of the consul, though be
usually named the man desired by the senate.

16 98. praeogativa] The new arrangement of the comitib centuniata
was in force at this time by which the Servian division into classes was
combined with the division into tribes. Eacb tribe was divided accord·
ing to wealth into five classes, each class according to age into two
balves. Thus each of the tribes contained ro centurias, and 70 centuries
(35 iurawmm, 35 seniorum) formed one class. The 18 centuries of
equites were added to the 350 centuriesforming the tribes. The knights
lost their privilege of voting first, and the century that voted first
(praerogantia) was chosen by lot.

according to fixed order. See Mommsen, R. H. 11. 353.

himself who was elected.

ar §⁸- intercessuros] the veto on arogation would seem to bavebeen
possible at any time before the voting was completed, perhaps even up
to the time of the declaration of the result. In case os electione, where
the candidates were lrnown beforehand, the intention to veto a candi·
date's election was declared at the opening of the proceedings. In the
present case, the candidates were not known apparently until the
praerogativa had given its vote. The incident is evidence that the

dictatorship at this time was not, as in earlier times, beyond the '

reach of tribuniciam intercession.
nomen accipere was said of the presiding magistrate who allowed a
’ candidate to be voted for os duly qualified. rationem tabere also used

in a technical sense os allowing the candidature os a person.
