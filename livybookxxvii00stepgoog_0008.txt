PREFACE.

HE text of this editionis based on that of Madvig,
second edition ¹by Madvig and Ussing, 1882. Varia·
tions are noticed in-the Notes on the Text. The edition of

Weissenborn referred to is the third, 1878. I have also used
Friedersdorfs (Teubner Series with German notes), but with

little advantage.

I have ventured for the sake of younger scholars, but
at the risk, I know, of being severely handled by more
advanced school-boys, to retain some old-fashioned spelling.
In particular, following Madvig, Ι have printed es always in
the third declension plurals.

A plan of Tarentum is added to explain c ις. But
I have not thought it worth while to insert general maps.
There are such excellent cheap classical atlases published
now, that it seemed superfluous to do so.

The references to Dr Mommsen's Roman History are to
the first edition of the English Translation. Emend. Liv.
means Madvig's Emendationes Livzbnae, second edition.

As in my edition of Livy, Book rv., Ι have not thought
it necessary to burden the notes with information‚ which
may readily be obtained from a good Dictionary, or from
other books of reference, to which a boy reading Livy ought
to have access.
