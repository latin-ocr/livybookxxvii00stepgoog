xvi LIVY. XXVII. ¹

Roman statel. The only colonies to be considered in this regard
were the Latin colonies. It seems natural enough therefore for

Livy to speak of thern as the thirty colonies of the Roman people
without adding ‘besides the maritime colonies.’

Socii in its widest sense meant any people in alliance with
another people. But, as the power of Rome increased‚ the
word in Roman state parlance acquired a special signification,
perhaps before, certainly after the full establishment of Roman
supremacy and the dissolution of the Latin League rac„ 338.
It came then to mean states bound to Rome by a treaty of
· perpetual alliance which imposed restrictions more or less on
‘their independence. One such restrictiori common· to all was
the prohibition to enter into any relations political, commercial
or connubial, with any other state except Rome. As parties
to such a treaty these states were also known as civitates
foederatae, also a term of general signification limited by
usage to a special political sense The States of the Latin
League were of course socz'i and foederati both in the widest
and in the narrower sense of the terms. But the ‘Latin Name²
had been extended by colonies planted by the League before
its dissolution, and by the Romans after. They therefore also
'were ‘allies‚' as in fact they were called in military arrange·
mentS, their contingents serving in the portion of the Roman
army known as socri. But as they were allies holding a special
relation to Rome, bound to Rome by a form of treaty common
to all (with an exception to be mentioned presently), as all
who became Latini, whether as members of a colony or as
members of a community received into the Latin N ame or Class,
entered into a known and, as it were, stereotyped relationship
with Rome, always imposing the same restrictions and giving
the same privileges, they were distinguished from the other
allies and federates, and the terms socii and fhederatae civi·
tates suffered in this regard a further restrictiori of meaning,
applying only to the allied states not included in the nomen
