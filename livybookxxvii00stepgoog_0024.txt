NOTES ΟΝ THE TEXII xxi

(Emend. bia, not in his latest text) aut ipre V. Laeainm traicere, aut
mittere.

8. 5 4. decemvir] Mg maintains this reading instead oi ress
decemvirum (partitive gen.) οιι the ground that the termination may
have been easily affected by the preceding accus.

ο. 513. qaod] Mg instead of nass qued

1.3.5 [aedri] Luchs. The combination cel a laedis' rs most

unusual. §Hand- Turseli, ιιι. 448.
2. 552, 3. flore] Mg, so avoiding vitrosa ellipsis of the verb ιιι

the 1rel. clause. remorandi Mss. The verb is only found here in
intrans. sense. The re might easily arise from the preceding ne.

ιθ. 511. cohortes quaeque] P, Mg. cohortesque quac Σ, Luchs,
Weissenb. Non rcctcsaaarantursr'ngali milites (a quibus)acohortibus, Mg.

1⁴. 5 13. quoque] sorte Σ, but it seems no improvement.

1⁶. 515. illo] P, Mg. praeponiasiscomplete, ‘incommand’.

10. 56. faciliori asecrrsa] Wesenberg's conj. ior facilior in as·
censum of Mss (a construction which has no parallel), adopted by most
editors, except Weissenb.

20. 53. exsequendo] Mg, ior Mss exequendas canticam in aliquid
faciendum is not Latin.

54. prooincia ct] Mg 'ior Mss provinciae regione, which would
imply that Carthaginian Spain was divided into provinces aster the
Roman fashion. Livy probably wrote ct regione to show that provincia
was used in a general sense.

22. 56. adaaaseiad12. addetum ctiam P, retained by Weis-
senb. Mg suggests as the true reading additum ct alcicd praesidium
provinciae.

513. caperentur] P. orerentur Σ, which Luchs is inclined to
believe right, thinking caperentur to be a mistake of the copyist oi P,
who just besore wrote caperet for caveret.

2⁴. 5 3. [tempus], probably gloss3 ii not, bidui must be read
instead ol' bilicum.

iussit praesteriae δια] Gronovius, followed by Mg, altered to iussi
praeficti because P has tribuni, bnt the reading ol the text seems best
supported.

59. movere possent praccaairsct] Σ. moveri posset carihat P, retained
by Mg. The rhythm ot' the former is better.

2ο. 58. duobus] P. die's added byWeissenb. Several tiss have

amplius qaam arrideo which is adopted by Mg. But the words look
like a gloss.
