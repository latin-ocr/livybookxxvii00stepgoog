sense obviously requires eo to be taken with addiderint. ipsos would
easily arise out oi ipsi si. . ·

ᾗ 11. nist] inserted by Mg. uss reading is nesab signis subsistere,
for which older editors read nec ab se'gnis absistere, later editors nx ab
signis abire (abscedere) nec subsistere. Mg objects (ι) that this would be
nearly, il not quite, impossible, (a) that isit were meant, Μηρώ),
would be required. Therefore he assumes the loss oi another word,
nm.

⁴¹7. 56. liaberet] Σ. See note.

5 9. somno dte] some editors change to itiam ac vigdiis danunt
somno corpora. But the difficulty ol somno does not justiiy the change.
See note.

§ro orbem] weissenb.’s suggested emendation oi uss morene,
which Mg and Luchs retain. errorem volvere seems too poetical even
ior Livy. Silius Ital. describing the same journey has exiguum
involvunt fmstratels gressibus orbern. xv. 624. ⁴

⁴8. ξ 14. dextrum] sinistrum MSS, as Mg says, is probably an
error oi Livy himself. In an edition oi this kind it seemed better to
make the correction in the text.

⁴0. §a regentis imperium sprenissmt] Μ. Miiller’s emend. The
uss are very corrupt. regendi spem Σ, adopted by Mg and Luchs, is e
very awkward expression (us Mg himself says in Emend. tin, where
he approves of Weissenb.'s regmtes sprevissent) and may easily have
been a corruption of au original corruption. P has regendis-permensum,
which seems to suggest regentis inperium uetesmt as the true reading.
