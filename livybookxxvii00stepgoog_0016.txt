· disorder, scattering themselves all over the field pecorum modo
incompositos, with no formation and no one in command of
them. It is not worth while here to speculate on the origin of
these inconsistencies‚ but taken in connection with the utter
improbability of the events recorded they help to stamp the
whole account as fabulous. The source of the fable of N ero’s
victories is easy to guess. The family legends of a house so
intimately connected with the imperial throne would of course
command the respectful attention of historiam, and must be
incorporated in their histories at any cost. Why the same
regard should be shown for an obvious falsehood in the family
records of a not distinguished branch of the Hostilii, it is
impossible to say.

Such are the legends which tend to obscure in Livy's
narrative the real respective positions of the contending parties
as they must have appeared to the Romans at the time. There
are some other inconsistent and evidently unhistorical state·
ments in this book, which it may be worth while briefly to
notice

1. ln c. 18 we have an account of a disastrous defeat
inflicted on Hasdrubal by Scipio at Baecula. The responsi·
bility for this fiction, or gross exaggeration, must apparently rest
with Scipio himself. For Polybius’ account of the same action
is substantially in agreement with Livy's, and he would in all
probability receive the account he gives from Scipio's friend
Laelius. The origin of the whole story is probably ‹lue to
Scipio's desire to cloak the blunder he evidently committed in
allowing Hasdrubal to leave Spain, the very thing that he was
sent to Spain to prevent. Polybius' account is less elaborate
than Livy's. Either the family history had grown between the
times of the two historians, or, what is more probable‚ Livy
improved in his own delightful way on Polybius But however
that may be, both accounts must bein the main fictitious.
Τ hat Scipio after inflicting such a defeat on Hasdrubal should,
with all the means of information he had athis command, allow
the defeated general to leave Spain unmolested‚ and that the
latter should arrive in Italy with what Livy himself calls ingens
exercitus, is simply incredible. The explanation given by Livy
