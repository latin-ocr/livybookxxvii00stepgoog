p. 13. ⁷ ir. mona] noy semus urs samerey a ue uec-
tion of a sacerdos. It was the election of oue oi the curioms (already
sacerdotes) to be presidentes them. The election os the Curio maximae
by the comitia (tn’buta, prob.) is explained by the sact that he was
regarded as a magistrate as well as a priest.

9 θα. potn‘ciir] Mommsen and Weissenb. assume that this was not
a protest oi individua] patriciam, but a rehusal on the partos the
patrician part oi the senate to sanction (amtoresfierr) the election. But
it would appear to be the only instance os such refusal since the altera·
tion referred to, o. 6,§6. ·

that is, ‘gare the people full power to decide the matter’. So xm. aa.

gods by auspices whether the person chosen was agreeable to them.

coegit] lt seems that in the case oi flamines and the rex sacrorum
the high priest had the power oi compulsory nominatiou. Compare the
caseos 1. Cornelius Dolabella in nc. 180 (xt. μ). He was duumuir
navalis, aud refusing to obey the order of the pontifex maximus to give
up his office in order to be appointed rex sacrorwm was fined by him. a
decisiou upheld on appeal by a majority oi the tribes, though in couse-
quenee of a vidum occurring the voting was not completed.

aa capim] the regular word used for selectiou by the high priest· So
vestalem capere. Aoo. to Weissenb. the full expression was manu capere
because the flamen or vestal was made over to the god by monopolio.
