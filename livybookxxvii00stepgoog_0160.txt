l vrchn] NOTES. 133¹

, 29 aquabantur] sc. Romani. notari, the subj. issi qui...essent.
l 3⁰ adustioris] notacommon word and notusedbefore Livy.
31 ἕ 8. simul dre] alias must be supplied before cimmerii, ‘to ride

round '‚ castra being the mons. after it.
³2 nunt] in dependent questions, as μή, suggests the possibility that what

follows it is true. num hac ita est? ‘this is not so, isitt’ But quaerit ,

num hoc ita sit, “he wants to know about that negative statement ‘this
is not so is it?'’', suggests a mbmving that it is not ‘not so', that is,
that it is so. So here the men were ordered to examine and see whether
the vallum was nat enlarged, as H. half suspected it was. So μὴ ἁμαρ-
τάνεις ‘you are not doing wrong, are yon?’ δέδοικα μὴ ἁμαρτάνεις, ‘I
fear you are doing wrong '.

p. 70. 54. ut] this change from the infin. to the subj. with or without
ut, after iubeo, is not uncommon in Livy. canat, it seems a question
whether in this and similar expressions cana is used intransitively, or
whether there is always an ellipse of tubicen as subj. to cana.

a aucta] the fact that the camp was nowhere enlarged.

faciebant] not ‘caused ’‚ but ‘was by way of, on the point of causing’,
only the experience of H. corrected the wrong impression before it was
completed.

5 5⁶· quo] in order to lengthen the lines of tems, cf. c. 46, ξ a.

7 signam] this must have been a day signal, cf. ἕ 8; it sounded just
before the coena began, when the day sentry duty ended; another was
sounded when the coena ended Itis hardly credible that two generals
in their senses would stultify all their other precautions for the sake of
a military regulation. Under the circumstances one signal would suffice
for both armies.

8 esse] the conclusion he drew.

ro ἕο. tantae dre] ought t0=ea usquc de tanta re deceptum ctelusum
esse, ‘had been sofar outwitted in such an important matter'. But
Livy would most likely have been surprised to be told so. He only
thought of the necessity for a striking and original expression; frustra-
tane required a gen. after it, so rn'is inserted meaning nothing, and
tantae for variety's sake made to agree with it.

12 habaet] the reading habuent, which Weissenb. and Madvig retain,
is more logically correct, but habaet regarded en sententia Hannibalis is
more vivid, ‘who (as he thought) lay encamped next door to him’.

aa §⁹- tranaait] used loosely: it would be partly swimming and partly
wading. The hexameter rhythm should be noticed: compare the open·
ing ot' his work, 11. 56. rand xxtr. 50. ro.
