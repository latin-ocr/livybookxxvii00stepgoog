INTRODUCTION II. xvii

[atinum. Hence the frequently occurring phrases socii ac
nomen Latinum, socii Latini nomimis.

From the year nc„ 268 there appear to have been two grades
oi the Latin states, that of the older foundations, and that oi
those, beginning with Ariminum, founded from nc 268 onwards.
¹Both grades of Latins were subject to the restriction mentioned
above prohibiting inter-state relations, both were required to
furnish troops according to the terms of a document known as
formula colonias in which was stated the maximum number
that could be demanded. Neither had the right oi appealing
‘from the decision oi a Roman magistrate. On the other hand
the old Latins retained a pretty lull measure oi autonomy.
They were not obliged to adopt Roman laws, were govemed at
home by their own magistrates, and exercised the right of
coining money. They enjoyed also commercium and conubium
with Rome, as well as what may be called a potential citizen·
ship. In virtue oi the right oi commercium a Latin could
acquire land or other property in Rome in sun ownership‚ could
adopt or be adopted by a 'Roman (the process involving manci-
patio), could leave legacies and receive legacies from Romans.
ln virtue of the right of conubium the children oi a Latin

Δ husband and a Roman wife or vice versa were legitimate. To

a Latin of the old foundation Roman citizenship was open on
his settlement in Rome, provided he leit ason to represent him
in his colony. But in the case os the later founded colonies,
beginning with Ariminum, these rights suffered some restric-
tions. (1) The autonomy os these states was to a certain extent
impaired by the withdrawal ol the right to coin silver money.
(2) They retained the right oi commercium but not conubium
with Rome. (3) They lost the right to become citizens by
settlement. The right oi a Latin to settle in Rome as cinti
sine suffragio, and as full citizen if he desired it and iulfilled the
condition mentioned above, existed from the earliest times.

But, as Rome grew in importance, the disinclination on the part
of the Romans to see this privilege exercised increased in
direct proportion to the inclination oi the Latius to exercise it.
Accordingly we find in tte 187 and luc 177 large numbers of
Latius expelled irum Rome, probably on the ground oi evasion
