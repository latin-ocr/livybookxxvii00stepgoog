As regards the narrative of the war in Italy the main interest
of the book lies of course in the latter part of it, the campaign
ending in the battle of the Metaurus. There can be little doubt
that to the Romans that was the decisive battle, the real
turning point in the war. Notwithstanding all the imaginative
