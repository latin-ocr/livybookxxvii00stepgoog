ΟΝ C. 9. THE LATIN COLONIES.

M ADVIG criticising Livy's statements in c. 9 01 this book

says that he speaks as if the Latin colonies were all -

the colonies the Romans had, and as it he was ignorant of the
distinction between colom'ae civium Romanorum und colonias
Latinae. But the criticism seems scarcely just. As regards the
expression in ᾖ 10 Romanos eos csse dte, on which Madvig lays

There was no question ol their deserting or standing by the

Roman state, sor they were part and parcel 01 that state,
differing only from the citizens at home in that they were
exempt lrom military service in the legions. because they were
perpetually serving on garrison duty, as standing outposts 01 the
