LIVY’S HISTORY OF THE YEARS B.C. nro—207.

HIS book contains the history oi the Second Punic War

between Rc„ 210 and 207. ln Rc. 211 Capua had been
recovered. In nc„ 210 Scipio was appointed to the conduct
of the War in Spain. The next year he began his career oi
diplomatic and military success in that country with the capture
ol New Carthage, and by the end of the same year had reduced
all Spain north oi the Iberus to complete submission. His
campaign oi the next year was marred by a great sailure, about
which the historians have left us completely in the dark¹. All
that we know ior certain is that Hasdrubal Barca was allowed
to leave Spain at the head os a large army, with which he
advanced the next year to Italy. Whatever are the laets of
the case, it is true, as Dr Mommsen says, that Scipio by his
action this year in Spain was mainly to blame lor the extremely
critical position oi Rome in the summer os ne 207, when
Hannibal's plan of a combined attack on the Romans was at
length realisedl. This sailure, however, the possible conse·
quences of which were so fortunately averted by the battle
of the Metaurus, was amply retrieved by tbe successes os the
next years, in which Scipio by a happy combination oi military
skill with personal influenee and attraction succeeded in con·
verting Spain “from a Carthaginian into a Roman province,
in which the conflict with the Romans was still continued
‘sor centuries by means os insurrection always repressed yet
never subdued, but in which at tbe moment no enemy stood
opposed to Rome³.'’

ln Sicily, by the time at which the narrative of this book
opens, the guerilla warsare carried on since Re 212 had been
brought to a close by the desertion of Muttines from the Cartha·
