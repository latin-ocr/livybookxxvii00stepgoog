of the conditions of settlement, and in ne 95 settlement was
absolutely forbidden. With this change apparently was con·
nected the restrictiori imposed on the later Latin colonies‚ by
which admission to Roman citizenship was granted only to
those who had held a magistracy or had been members of the
senate in their own colonies‚ provided also that, as before, they
left a son to represent them in the colony.

From these facts it is easy to see why these colonies
determined that they must live or die with Rome. On the one
hand they were isolated and estranged from their neighbours,
regarded by them as interlopers On the other, they were
bound to Rome by social and commercial connections‚ which
were the growth of years. To sever those connections by
joining a foreign invader would have been suicidal lt could
at hest be only a disadvantageous change of masters. They
could not hope to be privileged above the rest of Hannibal’s

Italian allies. At the worst (and the worst was very prohahle) .

it might mean being turned out of their lands to make room
either for the original owners or for Carthaginian colonists, and
becoming part of the town-rahble of a Carthaginian Rome.
