24 8 1. Mass] subject to the subordinate clause only, is placed out·
side oi it to give promineuce to the name and mark the transition from
Apulia and Marcellus to Capua and Flaccus.

Muri δια] cf. xxvi. 34. 3-6. Amongst other punishments inflicted
on the Capuans in rac. arr, the land and personat property os all who
had been senators, or had held any office, were confiscated.

26 flumenta] 1t is not clear whether this is to be understood literally
olerent paid in corn only, or ol a rent in kind generally. 'Ibe ager

, Campanus seems never tc have been occupied by possessores technically

so called, but to have been let in small iarms to temporary lessees. ΤῙιο
letting ol ager publa'cus was generally managed by the censors at Rome,

J and Livy tells ns (c. rufi 8) thatin nc. ²09 the censore let the ager

Campanus. What was the necessity tor the second letting so soon after
the first he does not tell ns. Possibly Flaccus had not nme to complete

os a divine purpose in mislortunes. The gods were determined that the
Capuans should never cease provoking the resentment oi the Romans,
as long as they existed. Friedersd. compares vrr. 27. r, xxv1.4r. 8.
On Livy's piety see Teuffel, Roman Lunature, 1. 500. Livy appears to
have no doubt that this tire as well as the tire in Rome (xxvi. ay) was
really the work ol Capuan conspirators. Dr Ihne (Runa. Hrit. 11. 344)
is ol opinion that the story about the origin ol the former tire was
concocted by the informer. ⁴
