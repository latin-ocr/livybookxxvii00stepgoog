of Julia, a new period of glorificatiou for the house of the

that redounded to the praise of the ancestors of the young man
in tbe glorious times of tbe Republic. Augustus himself com·
posed a historical work on this subject, and we cannot fail to per·
ceive that Livy wrote under the influence of the Augustan court
He treats Marcellus as a favourite hero, and even in Plutarch
we can trace the preference accorded to Marcellus. If we
deduct all that family conceit and national pride have invented
about Marcellus there remains indeed the image of a genuine
Roman of the old type, of an intrepid soldier and an energetic
officer. But the parallel between Marcellus and Pelopidas
seems inappropriate, and all comparison between him aud
Hannibal is absurd¹.” If anythiug more than the statement of
Polybius alluded to in this passage were required, it would be
found in the absurd inconsistencies of Livy’s narrative. (1)
The first of these occurs in tbe account of the indecisive engage-
ment described in c. 2. This engagement lasted from nine
o'clock in the morning or thereabouts till nightfall, without
decisive result. Both sides had reserves at hand. Yet neither
used them until it was too late, and the ‘fierce vigorous fighting
of the fresh troops' must have been dropped almost as soon as it
began, unless there were two nigbts to that day. But this is a
minor inconsistency. (2) In cc. 12—14we have the accounts

· of three battles, one indecisive, the second ending in the defeat

of Marcellus, the third a decisive victory for the Romans Yet
in spite of this brilliant success, Marcellus spent the rest of the
season in quarters at Venusia, as is tacitly implied in c. 155 1,
and stated by the accusing tribune (c. 21 ᾖ 3), who could hardly
have ignored Marcellus' victory, as he did, if it were notorious
at the time. Marcellus is said indeed to bave erusbed him
commoratione rerum suarum,· but the expression is vague,
and, ifthe trutb were known, is probably an euphemism for the
political influence of the Claudii in Rome. lt was the great
number of tbe wounded that kept Marcellus inactive‚ Livy says.
‘Almost all were wounded,' Plutarch says, improviug on Livy.
But he gives no reason lor the remarkable disproportion between
