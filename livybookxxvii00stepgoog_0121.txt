cboice oi princeps was the first business in 'revising the Seuate list, and
that the censore drew lota to decide which should appoint. Livy, as
Weissenb. says, annot mean that oue censor managed the whole
revision, because in xl.. 51. ι he says cessores fideli concordia senatum
legerunt. In fact this casting lots sor the lectio principis does not appear
elsewhere. xxxiv. 44. 4, we have censores...pn'ncs]uem senatus P. Scipio
nem quem et prims emeres legerant legemur. Il also the choice was
assigned by lot, there seems no ground ior the other censor’s interserence,
and the principle he enunciates was not acted upon in later times
certainly. Ι .

to sell it (vmdm iubere) seem to have been equivalent expressions.
The question suggests itself (and 1 believe no one has answered it) who
got the price, the eques or the state? Perhaps it depended on what the
cause was for which the horse was taken away. In the present case itis
clear that either the actual horsea were taken away, or the price refunded

to the state. Otherwise the equites could not be said to serve equis η
