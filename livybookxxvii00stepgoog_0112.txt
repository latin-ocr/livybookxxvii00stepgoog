hnd been three coordinrte assemblies at Rome, the comitia centunbta
and tributa of the whole people, and the concilim pletis. The division
of functione between them is obscure, the more so as the term comitia
tributa seems to have been applied to the concilium plebis as well. The
business of the centuriate assembly seems by this time to have become
practically conlined to the election of consuls, censors and praetors, end
the decreeing os aggressive war.

the provinces vves not ager Romanus. In earlier times the term was
contined to the precincts of the city itself.

²3 §1⁰- tutunus] The tribunes had atthis time the right to bring
motions before the senate and to summon it. When they acquired this
right is quite uncertain, but it would follovv naturally from the Hortensian
