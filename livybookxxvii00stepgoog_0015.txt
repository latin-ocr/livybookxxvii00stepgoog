killed and wounded‚ which moreover is quite inconsistent with
the laets of the engagement as described c 14 ἕξ 10-13.

Such are the inconsistencies in tbe Marcellan narrative
ln c. 40 sol. we bave the wonderful successes oi Hostilius
Tubulus and Claudius Nero, tbe first intlicting one, tbe second
two serious defeats on H annibal himself. That these are iabu-
lous we may conclude with certainty3 (1) from the consciousness
ol tbe Romans expressed both by Livy¹ and by Appian² that a
junction with Hasdrubal would bave decided the war in Han-
nibal's favour; (a) from the fact that alter the defeat of Hasdrubal,
Hannibal could still dely the Romans, acting on the defensive
for three years longer, and only leaving ltaly, when the Roman
attack on Carthage recalled him to defend his native land, and
leaving it then in his own way and without molestation.

The accounts os the battles themselves contain indications
os their untrustworthy character. Hostilius for example is said
to have attached Hannibal when the latter was marching from
Bruttium and Lucania into the country of tbe Sallentini per
extremum finem agri Larinatis. That is to say, Hannibal was
marching to the north os Apulia on bis way to 'Calabria
Madvig by way oi making Livy consistent bas altered Larinatis
to Uriatis (the district round Un'a or Hyn'a, the ancient metro·
polis of the Messapii), but the former is the reading of all the
Mss, and most probably what Livy wrote. Further, Hostilius
atthis time was either at Capua or Tarentum (c 35 ἓ 14), or on
bis way from the latter to the former. How then comes be to
be attacking Hannibal in a district about 130 miles north os
Tarentum? And how comes Hannibal (ἕ 12) aiter this deleat
to be encamping in the Tarentino territory from which he
retires south on bearing that A Claudius was advancing
against him from his winter quarters among the Sallentini?
Then again in the account of N ero's first deleat ot' Hannibal, in

order to account sorbis success, Hannibal's veteran and highly
disciplined troops (c. 42 ἕ 3) under his own command are re·
presented as rushing out os the camptu attaclr Nero in utter
